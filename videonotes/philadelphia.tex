\mbox{} \\\textbf{Thematic Notes:} \\~\\
   In the greater context of Chapter 32, \textit{Philadelphia} centers around the AIDS crisis of the 1980s and 1990s, especially starting in the homosexual community. The film also depicts the state of gay rights and the social stigma of homosexuality in the 1990s: the ruling in favor of Andy Beckett does represent significant progress for the gay rights movements; however, numerous parts of society had still clearly not progressed (for example, when another man suggests that lawyer Joe Miller is gay, he immediately gets angry and repulsed; furthermore,scenes are shown with the use of anti-gay slurs and jokes). Although the spread of AIDS further expanded the stigma of homosexuality, the United States has certainly progressed significantly in the last 30 years.
