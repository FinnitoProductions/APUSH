            \begin{itemize}
                \item Reagan was originally skeptical of Gorbachev, but gradually came to accept his desire for reform
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Worked together, holding a summit in Iceland and at their respective capitals aimed to reduce nuclear weapons
                \end{itemize}
                \item Two leaders soon agreed to remove nuclear arsenals from Europe; Gorbachev ended long war in Afghanistan 
            \end{itemize}

        \cornell{What led Reagan's influence to wane in American politics?}{
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Political scandals which had originally been hidden due to Reagan's pure popularity began to come to light
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Included corruption, illegality, ethical lapses, and significant deregulation of loan industry
                    \item Most significant scandal: American government had sold weapons to Iran's revolutionary government in a failed attempt to release Americans held in the Middle East
                    \item Other money illegaly funneled to assist Nicaraguan \textit{contras}
                \end{itemize}
                \item Numerous other illegal activities were exposed, damaging Reagan presidency
            \end{itemize}
            \textbf{Reagan's influence began to fade after numerous illegal activities were exposed, most significantly the selling of weapons to Iran's revolutionary government.}

        \cornell{How did George H.W. Bush come to power?}{
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Fraying of Reagan administration gave Democrats significant hope, but very few popular figures ran for the nomination
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Ultimately went to little-known Michael Dukakis, a dull campaigner
                    \item Remained confident in prospects: opponent, George H.W. Bush, had failed to spark any public interest
                \end{itemize}
                \item Turn-around beginning at the Republican Convention, where Bush began to heavily attack Dukakis, tying to negative stigma of the "liberal"
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Bush won presidency, but Democrats secured majority in both houses
                \end{itemize}
            \end{itemize}
            \textbf{George H.W. Bush was initially seen as a write-off due to the negative outlook on the Republican party caused by Reagan; however, his eventual harsh words against the Democratic party sparked great interest within the public, earning himself the spot as president.}

        \cornell{What were the most significant events in the Bush Presidency?}{
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Bush experienced large popularity during first three years due to subdued image, careful responses against major world events
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Eventually cooperated with Gorbachev to reach agreements with Soviet Union in arm-reduction
                \end{itemize}
                \item Much less successful on domestic issues, having to deal with heavy burden of debt created by Reagan
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Pledges to reduce deficit conflicted with promises of no new taxes
                    \item Congress and White House agreed on many significant measures
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item Cooperated to salvage savings and loan industry, eventually decided on significant tax increase to reduce deficit
                    \end{itemize}
                    \item Neither Congress nor Bush had solution to recession beginning in 1990, increasing grip on economy by 1992
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item Enormous debt had led to numerous bankruptcies, increased fear among American middle/working classes
                        \item Put pressure on government to address rising cost of health care
                    \end{itemize}
                \end{itemize}
                \item The \textbf{Gulf War} was caused by the United States reducing military spending to focus on economic interests as a result of becoming the only major superpower after USSR collapse
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Invaded Panama, overthrowing military leader and forcibly replacing with elected leader
                    \item When Hussein announced plans to annex oil-rich Kuwait, Bush led campaign to force out
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item Convinced nearly all important nations (including USSR and other Arab nations) to place trade embargo on Iraq
                        \item UN supported expulsion by military invasion; American forces began to bombard Iraqi forces in Kuwait
                        \item Bombing continued for six weeks until American ground forces (under Norman Schwarzkopf) invaded from unexpected north without resistance
                        \begin{itemize}
                            \item Killed more than one hundred thousand Iraqis, finally led to cease-fire agreement with acceptance of terrorism
                        \end{itemize}
                        \item Many Muslims, angered by US hostility against religious bretheren combined with female forces, took to terrorism to target Americans
                    \end{itemize}
                \end{itemize}
            \end{itemize}
            \textbf{Bush's popularity grew due to his careful responses to important events on the world stage; however, domestic issues, most significantly the 1990 recession, challenged the public opinion of him. Perhaps the most significant event was the brief Gulf War, the bombardment of Iraq for their invasion of oil-rich Kuwait. It marked the rapid growth of hatred for America especially among the most conservative Muslims, beginning an age of frequent terrorism in the Western world.}

                \item Early plans for 1992 election began when Bush's popularity had spiked, leading few Democrats to run
