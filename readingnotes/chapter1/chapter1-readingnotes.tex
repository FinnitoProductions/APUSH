    \cornell[America Before Columbus]{What were the major characteristics of pre-Columbian America?}{}
    \cornell{What were the origins and lifestyles of the peoples of precontact Americas?}{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Initial belief that all early migrations to Americas from humans crossing Bering Land bridge as result of newly developed tools
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Referred to as "Clovis" people, originated from Mongolian stock connected to Siberia
                \item Clovis established first American civilizations, eating animals and creating tools
                \item Gradually expanded to warmer region
            \end{itemize}
            \item Recent evidence has revealed that earlier Asian migrants had already arrived in South America long before Clovis
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Likely arrived by boat (backed up by early population of Japan, Australia, Pacific)
            \end{itemize}
            \item Early population far more diverse/ scattered than scholars originally believed 
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Some likely arrived from Polynesia, Japan; possible from Europe/Africa
                \item Most American Indians most similar to Siberians: Mongolians likely dominated 
            \end{itemize}
            \item Period referred to as "Archaic Period"  ($\approx$ 8000 - 3000 BCE)
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Larger animals driven to extinction with spear-hunting, stone tools
                \item Bows and arrows unknown until 400-500 CE 
                \item New tools emerged, including fishing nets, traps, gathering baskets
                \item Most important crop waas corn, followed by beans/squash in many communities
                \item Sedentary settlements slowly began to form
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        \textbf{The earliest settlers in America, opposite to the long-held belief that they had arrived over the Bering Land Bridge, likely travelled by boat from Polynesia, Japan, and Mongolia. They arrived with stone tools but gradually developed more advanced technology, including baskets, nets, and fishing traps. Their most significant crops were corn, beans, and squash.}

    \cornell{What defined the growth of early South American civilizations?}{
        The most prosperous early civilizations were in fact south of the United States, mostly in Central/South America and Mexico. \\~\\
        The Incas built a 2000-mile empire in the Peruvian region.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item 
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Persuaded most leaders to join forces w/ them 
                \item Connected by paved roads, which encouraged significant trade 
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        \textbf{The expansive Incan Empire was the dominant force in South America for multiple decades, known for their well-kept paved roads.}
    }
    \cornell{What defined the growth of pre-Aztec civilizations in Central America?}{
        In Mesoamerica, civilization emerged as early as 10000 BCE.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Olmec society emerged around 1000 BCE 
            \item Most sophisticated: Mayans around 800 CE
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Written language, numerical system, calendar, agriculture, trade routes
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        \textbf{The civilizations in Central America emerged far earlier than those in South America. Significant prosperity began with the Olmecs around 1000 BCE, followed by the Mayans, both of whom were known for a written language and calendar.}
    }
    \cornell{What were the key characteristics of the Aztec Empire?}{
        The Mayans were gradually suceeded by the Aztecs, who called themselves the Mexica.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Established city of Tenochtitlan in modern Mexico City 
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Became largest American city \textit{by far}
                \item Characterized by many aqueducts, public buildings, organized military 
            \end{itemize}
            \item Incorporated other neighboring groups into society
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Rather than directly conquering, drew into elaborate tribute network enforced by military
                \item Most groups maintained significant autonomy
            \end{itemize}
            \item Religion based on human sacrifice
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Kept historical tradition of blood-letting
                \item Introduced new concept of living hearts (generally captives)
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        \textbf{The Aztecs were the last successful native civilization in Central America. Despite having been crushed by European disease, the Aztecs were the dominant force in southern North/Central America for centuries due to their extensive tribute system and large capital city.}
