Initially, almost all were characterized by hunting-and-gathering lifestyles, but agriculture slowly emerged, subsequently changing society and tribal culture significantly. Notable Native American hotspots include Mesoamerica, Peru, and the Southwest U.S.}}
    \cornell{What were the origins and lifestyles of the peoples of precontact Americas?}{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Initial belief that all early migrations to Americas from humans crossing Bering Land bridge as result of newly developed tools
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Referred to as "Clovis" people, originated from Mongolian stock connected to Siberia
                \item Clovis established first American civilizations, eating animals and creating tools
                \item Gradually expanded to warmer region
            \end{itemize}
            \item Recent evidence has revealed that earlier Asian migrants had already arrived in South America long before Clovis
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Likely arrived by boat (backed up by early population of Japan, Australia, Pacific)
            \end{itemize}
            \item Early population far more diverse/ scattered than scholars originally believed 
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Some likely arrived from Polynesia, Japan; possible from Europe/Africa
                \item Most American Indians most similar to Siberians: Mongolians likely dominated 
            \end{itemize}
            \item Period referred to as "Archaic Period"  ($\approx$ 8000 - 3000 BCE)
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Larger animals driven to extinction with spear-hunting, stone tools
                \item Bows and arrows unknown until 400-500 CE 
                \item New tools emerged, including fishing nets, traps, gathering baskets
                \item Most important crop waas corn, followed by beans/squash in many communities
                \item Sedentary settlements slowly began to form
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        \textbf{The earliest settlers in America, opposite to the long-held belief that they had arrived over the Bering Land Bridge, likely travelled by boat from Polynesia, Japan, and Mongolia. They arrived with stone tools but gradually developed more advanced technology, including baskets, nets, and fishing traps. Their most significant crops were corn, beans, and squash.}

    \cornell{What defined the growth of early South American civilizations?}{
        The most prosperous early civilizations were in fact south of the United States, mostly in Central/South America and Mexico. \\~\\
        The Incas built a 2000-mile empire in the Peruvian region.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Persuaded most leaders to join forces w/ them 
                \item Connected by paved roads, which encouraged significant trade 
            \end{itemize}
        \textbf{The expansive Incan Empire was the dominant force in South America for multiple decades, known for their well-kept paved roads.}

    \cornell{What defined the growth of pre-Aztec civilizations in Central America?}{
        In Mesoamerica, civilization emerged as early as 10000 BCE.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Olmec society emerged around 1000 BCE 
            \item Most sophisticated: Mayans around 800 CE
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Written language, numerical system, calendar, agriculture, trade routes
            \end{itemize}

    \cornell{What were the key characteristics of the Aztec Empire?}{
        The Mayans were gradually suceeded by the Aztecs, who called themselves the Mexica.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Established city of Tenochtitlan in modern Mexico City 
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Became largest American city \textit{by far}
                \item Characterized by many aqueducts, public buildings, organized military 
            \end{itemize}
            \item Incorporated other neighboring groups into society
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Rather than directly conquering, drew into elaborate tribute network enforced by military
                \item Most groups maintained significant autonomy
            \end{itemize}
            \item Religion based on human sacrifice
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Kept historical tradition of blood-letting
                \item Introduced new concept of living hearts (generally captives)
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        \textbf{The Aztecs were the last successful native civilization in Central America. Despite having been crushed by European disease, the Aztecs were the dominant force in southern North/Central America for centuries due to their extensive tribute system and large capital city.}

    \cornell{What characterized the early North American civilizations?}{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Northern civilizations did not develop elaborate political systems, primarily basing society on hunting/gathering/fishing
            \item Some civilizations primarily based around hunting/fishing
            \begin{itemize} 
                \item In Arctic Circle, Eskimos fished/hunted seals/caribou/moose, travelled by dogsled
                \item In PNW, focused on salmon fishing with coastal settlements
                \item Far West contained numerous successful fishing communities, with some gathering
            \end{itemize}
            \item Most elaborate agricultural society in Southwest 
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Built irrigation for dryland farming, towns as trade centers 
                \item Architecture primarily stone/adobe, known as pueblos
            \end{itemize}
            \item Other farming communities in Great Plains, though some hunted buffalo
            \item Eastern U.S., covered with forests, inhabited by Woodland Indians
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Enjoyed most food on continent; farmed, fished, hunted, gathered
                \item Major city of trade: \textbf{Cahokia}, larged mound society
                \item Northeastern societies far more nomadic due to less fertile terrain
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Techniques designed for quick exploitation, immediately killing land 
                    \item Moved after a few years, dispersing in winter
                \end{itemize}
                \item Tribes east of Mississippi unified by linguistic roots
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Largest language group: Algonquian (Atlantic from Canada to Virginia)
                    \item Iroquoian centered in upstate NY 
                    \begin{itemize}

        \textbf{Early North American civilizations were characterized by vastly different traits: many fished and hunted (especially in the northwest), others focused on agriculture (mostly iun Southwest w/ adobe style), and others were primarily nomadic (like in the Northeast). Finally, most tribes east of the Mississippi were unified by linguistic roots, but they rarely made connections because of this.}

            \begin{itemize}
                \item Generally gods associated with crops, game, forests, rivers, etc. 
                \item Many tribes used colored totems for rituals, large festivals 
            \end{itemize}
            \item Social stratification continued with division of tasks by gender
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Women \textit{always} cared for children, prepared meals
                \item Farming often restricted to men (Pueblos), but others relied on men for hunting, battles
                \item Women respected for ability to keep family together while men battled/hunted 
                \begin{itemize}

        \end{itemize}
        \textbf{By the arrival of Europeans, almost all tribes had begun to adopt a sedentary, agricultural lifestyle. Settling often led to defined religion based around their natural environment; furthermore, agriculture increased social division between men and women.}

    \cornell{What incentivized Europeans to look for new lands?}{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Population rebound from Black Death led to rising land value, greater merchant class seeking goods to trade, and advanced navigational technology
            \item New united governments seen as necessary due to weak authority of church had sufficient wealth to expand beyond Europe

                \item Colony nearly collapsed after Pueblo revolts in 1680
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Sparked by priest/government suppression of tribal rituals
                    \item Heavily influenced by major drought, Apache raids leading to instability within natives
                    \item Religious leader named Pope led uprising killing hundreds of Europeans, capturing Santa Fe
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item Drove Spanish out temporarily
                        \item Soon returned (1696), crushing final revolts 
                    \end{itemize}
                \end{itemize}
                \item Exploitation of Pueblos continued, but Spanish understood severity and allowed natives to own land, focused on greater integration into society
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Led to significant intermarriage
                    \item Pueblos began to view Spanish as allies against Apache/Navajo 
                \end{itemize}
                \item By 1750, Pueblo population had declined (disease/war/migration) while Spanish had grown somewhat
            \end{itemize}
            \textbf{Spain's outpost in the Southwest, despite being one of their most successful northern outposts, was known for harsh treatment of the natives through forced labor, tribute, and suppression of rituals. Damaging rebellions forced the Spanish to successfully reduce their exploitation through land ownership and social integration.}}
            \cornell{What was the peak of Spanish America?}{\begin{itemize}
                \item By the 16th century, Spanish Empire had become one of largest in world history
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Caribbean, Mexico, coastal/inland South America (to Brazil), southern North America
                \end{itemize}
                \item Different from eventual English colonies in many ways
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Despite initial independence from monarchy, gradual exercise of control with impossibility for independent political institutions
                    \item Spanish more successful in extracting wealth from surface but placed little emphasis on building agriculture/commerce
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item Strict Spanish commercial policies (never imposed by British) w/ only one Spanish port, a few colonial ports allowed for trade, two voyages per year
                    \end{itemize}
                    \item Spanish placed considerably less effort than British, French, Dutch on peopling new society
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item Some from mainland, others from Spanish outposts
                        \item Always outnumbered by natives, attempting to impose rule over large group
                    \end{itemize}
                \end{itemize}
            \end{itemize}
            \textbf{Spanish America's peak realm included a large portion of the American continent group. However, their success was limited due to strict monarchical control over the economy and politics and their inability to people society significantly.}}
            \cornell{What were the key biological and cultural exchanges in Spanish America?}{
            Unlike in British colonies, racial lines began to blur, but culture remained relatively distinct. Despite this, numerous exchanges occured between natives and settlers.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Mostly unbeneficial for natives
                    \begin{itemize}
                    \item Inadvertent spread of diseases like flu, measles, chicken pox, typhus, \textbf{smallpox}
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item Led to practical extinction of many native groups in Mexico, Caribbean islands (like Hispaniola, Mayan areas)
                        \item Some more successful with less intimate European contact 
                        \item Far worse than Black Death
                    \end{itemize}
                    \item More deliberate decimation of populations through subjugation, extermination
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item Reflected ruthfulness of European war
                        \item Result of conviction that natives were "savages"
                    \end{itemize}
                    \item Relied on for slave-like labor system 
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item Forced to work for fixed period, unable to depart without employer consent
                        \item Europeans began to value native villages over gold due to potential for great labor
                    \end{itemize}
                \end{itemize}
                \item Some forms of exchange less disastrous
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item New crops (sugar/bananas), livestock (cattle/pigs/sheep), and \textbf{horse} (vanished during ice age, transforming native lifestyle)
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item Imported solely for Europeans, but natives slowly learned how to cultivate and harness power
                    \end{itemize}
                    \item Europeans learned about new agricultural techniques, crops (corn, squash, potatoes, tomatoes, peppers) even reaching Europe
                    \item Many societies involved natives in close contact with Europeans, encouraging natives to adopt European practices
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item Led to creation of new mixed dialects
                        \item Adoption of Christianity led to blend with native traditions
                    \end{itemize}
                    \item European men outnumbered women by 10:1, leading to sexual contact with native women 
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item Society became dominated by mixed-race \textit{mestizos}
                        \item Hierarchy placed Spanish at top, mixed race in middle, natives at bottom, though far more fluid than expected with "Spanish" assigned to anyone powerful
                    \end{itemize}
                \end{itemize}
            \end{itemize}
            \textbf{Exchanges between the natives and settlers were mixed in character: negative exchanges included the spread of disease and the subjugation of native populations into a slave-like labor system while postive included the mutual spread of agricultural techniques, crops, and culture.}

            The decline of native population in Spanish America forced the settlers to turn to a new region for slave labor: Africa.
