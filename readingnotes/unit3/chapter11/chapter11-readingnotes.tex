    \cornell[Key Concepts]{What are this chapter's key concepts?}{\begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{4.1.II.D} - Communities emerged allowing enslaved/free Afr. Americans to protect cultural and social heritage w/ political goals to improve status
        \item \textbf{4.1.III.B} - North saw successful abolitionist movements w/ growing free black populations, but govt. still restricted rights; only form of rebellion in South were failed uprisings
        \item \textbf{4.2.III.B} - Southern cotton production paired w/ Northern manufacturing -> growth of U.S. commercial ties, both domestic and w/ other nations
        \item \textbf{4.2.III.C} - Southerners relied on export of agriculture -> unique regional identity
        \item \textbf{4.3.II.A} - Overcultivation in Southeast -> west of Appalachians saw more successful slave plantations
        \item \textbf{4.3.II.B} - Majority of Southerners non-slave-owners, but most still argued that slavery was part of life
    \end{itemize}}
    \cornell[The Cotton Economy]{What were the essential characteristics of the southern cotton economy and what were its effects?}{\textbf{Cotton began to dominate existing sugar, rice, and tobacco cultivation in the South, becoming central by the 1860s, causing slave populations to skyrocket, particularly in the Deep South. However, industry remained subordinate to the plantation economy, with many fearing a growing industrial dependence on the North; little changed, however, because of the inherent profitability of land, long-term investment in lands limiting investment elsewhere, and a unique set of gracious, "cavalier" ideals.}}
    \cornell{What were the conditions of Southern economies before the advent of cotton?}{\begin{itemize}
        \item Upper South had continued to rely on unstable boom-bust, land-exhausting tobacco market; VA, NC, MD began to shift to wheat
        \item Southern regions of coastal South (SC, GA, FL) relied on stable rice cultivation requiring long growing season -> kept within small area
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Some long-staple cotton growth, but could only grow in limited coastal area
        \end{itemize}
        \item Gulf Coast growers enjoyed successful yet labor-intensive sugar industry
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Only accessible to wealthy planters, significant competition w/ Caribbean -> kept to southern LA, eastern TX
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \textbf{The Upper South continued to engage in the unstable tobacco industry with some shifts to wheat production, the coastal southern South focused on rice cultivation with a long growing season, and the Gulf Coast farmers focused on the sugar industry. All of these were restricted to a small growing area.}}
    \cornell{How did cotton transform Southern farming?}{\begin{itemize}
        \item Short-staple cotton, able to grow in mixed climates, initially unpopular due to difficulty of separating seeds; solved by cotton gin
        \item High demand from British and New England textile industry -> immigration to uncultivated lands for cotton regions
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Spread from western SC/GA to AL, MS, LA, TX, AR, \textit{central by 1850s}
            \item Overproduction to meet demand -> frequent busts, but growth continued w/ cotton becoming $\frac{2}{3}$ of U.S. exports and 100x more valuable than rice
        \end{itemize}
        \item Era known as "Cotton Kingdom" w/ large profits and white settlers moving in large quantities to the South, some wealthy planters simply transferring assets, but most were smaller farmers 
        \item Slave population in lower South grew significantly (over 10x in AL/MS) while upper South grew far less
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Many slaves accompanied upper South masters; others simply sold -> econ. of upper South grew
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \textbf{Short-staple cotton, due to the invention of the cotton gin, grew significantly, becoming the most significant American export crop and bringing large profits to the Deep South. It also caused a significant shift in slavery away from the upper South toward the Deep South.}}
    \cornell{What forms of industry emerged amidst the growth of cotton?}{\begin{itemize}
        \item Merchants/manufacturers significant w/ textile/iron/flour milling particularly in upper South (\textit{ex}: Tredegar Iron Works comparable to largest of Notheast)
        \item Industry grew, but still paled in comparison w/ cotton production
        \item Southern commercial sector generally assisted plantations, w/ \textbf{brokers, or "factors"} of southern towns to market crops
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Financial system weak w/ factors providing credit to plantation owners, debt growing during cotton decline periods -> merchant-bankers influential 
            \item Lawyers/editors/doctors dependent on plantation economy 
        \end{itemize}
        \item Transportation remained inadequate w/ no investment in canals, roads unable to carry heavy loads, railroads unable to truly tie
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Memphis only true hub connecting to Northeast, w/ Charleston/Atlanta/Savannah/Norfolk/Richmond having direct connections
            \item Majority remained disconnected from national system, w/ some lines between rivers but most relying on \textit{river and sea} transport 
        \end{itemize}
        \item Most southerners recognized economic inferiority to North
        \begin{itemize}
            \item AR journalist Albert Pike complained about dependence on North 
            \item James B.D. De Bow of New Orleans created \textit{De Bow's Review} from 1846-1880 emphasizing importance of agricultural/commercial growth 
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Lamented potential "colonial" relationship betw. South/North; believed significant money lost 
                \item Printed in NY w/ advertisements from northern manufacturers; sold signif. less in South than Northern magazines did in similar regions
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \textbf{Although a small industrial sector developed in the South, it remained mostly dependent on and overshadowed by the plantation economy. Industry was further stagnated by weak transportation, with few railroads and canals meaning that rivers and the sea remained the priamry means of transportations. Many Southerners lamented their inferiority to and dependence on the North.}}
    \cornell{What were key causes for the South's continual dependence on agriculture?}{\begin{itemize}
        \item Profitability of lands -> few looked further; wealthy had majority of investments in land; climate potentially not conducive to industry; many in North felt South lacked work ethic
        \item Unique Southern values based on traditional chivalry/leisure/elegance far more gracious than northern "yankees": above industrial work
    \end{itemize}
    \textbf{Despite lamentations from many Southerners concerning their industrial dependence on the North, few were able to move beyond agriculture due to inherent land profitability, great investments made in existing lands, a hot climate, and, according to many Northerners, a weak work ethic. Personally, many Southerners felt their chivalric role as "cavaliers" meant they were above the toil of industry.}}
    \cornell[White Society in the South]{How was Southern society structured for whites?}{\textbf{White society saw a disproportionately dominant planter class whose hard work was often masked behind a genteel image who focused on maintaining honor and dignity by protecting and subordinating women, who often had limited access to education and suffered from adulterous husbands (with slaves) and infant mortality. The lower classes generally owned few slaves but, apart from the highlanders (who actively rebelled against the plantation system) and the "white trash," (whose poverty gave them little means to rebel), most were deeply ingrained in and economically connected with plantation society. Class conflict remained limited, however, due to the continual white belief in racial superiority (a form of leadership) and close family connections between members of disparate classes.}}
    \cornell{How did slaveowning whites compare to non-slaveowning whites?}{\textbf{A relatively small minority of Southern whites owned slaves: slaveowning families (including all members of the family) amounted to at most one quarter of the population. Most owned very few.}}
    \cornell{How did the planter class dominate Southern society?}{\begin{itemize}
        \item Planter aristocracy had disproportionate influence in society
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Controlled all life of region 
            \item Received great incomes, owned large homes and pieces of land, often spent months in urban homes 
            \item Some travelled to Europe, hosted large social events
        \end{itemize}
        \item Most southerners compared planter class to old upper classes of England/Europe: long aristocracies, but in fact very disparate 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item In some parts of VA, a long aristocracy had developed
            \item Most planters relatively new to profession, many first-generation settlers who had underwent large struggle
            \item "Old South" (pre-Civil War) settled for less than two decades when war began
        \end{itemize}
        \item Few planters enjoyed true relaxation: great competitions with industry as risky as North
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Required skilled overseeing; many planters invested majority of wealth in money/slaves and lived in lesser conditions
            \item Planters often forced to move to lands with greater agriculture
            \item Many planters had worked hard $\to$ perhaps created "cavalier" image to defend their rights (particularly in lower, new South)
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \textbf{Although the planter class had a disproportionate social influence, often owning vast tracts of land, they were very different from Britain's aristocracy of the past: most were relatively new to their positions of wealth and still had to work hard to earn their money and prevent competition from other planters.}}
    \cornell{How did southern whites perpetuate an aristocratic image?}{\textbf{Most southern whites avoided trade and commerce, known as "coarse" occupations. Many wealthier members joined the military to fulfill the image of the medieval knight, often acting chivalric toward women.}}
    \cornell{How did white males develop a code of chivalry?}{\begin{itemize}
        \item White males felt required to defend honor -> frequent dueling (mostly vanished in the North); treated each other w/ great respect to distance from great cruelty of slavery 
        \item Beyond bravery, idea of honor significant for public image: maintaining pride/dignity by fighting all which challenged 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textit{ex}: SC congressman Preston Brooks beat Senator Charles Sumner of MA w/ cane for insult against relative -> South saw as hero, North as savage
            \item Greater focus on defending honor by avenging insults, particularly against women
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \textbf{White males focused greatly on the ideal of "honor," a virtue requiring defending at all costs. Any insult to one's dignity or to a woman required direct retaliation to save one's public image.}}
    \cornell{How were wealthy women of the South generally treated?}{\begin{itemize}
        \item Comparable to Northern middle-class w/ life in home, directly assisting husbands and raising children
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Rarely partook in public activities/employment for money (unlike North)
            \item Honor -> men should defend women -> white women even more subordinate, requiring to obey for protection 
        \end{itemize}
        \item Most women lived on farms without public access -> no ways of looking beyond roles in life
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Male dominance in South > than in North because more at-home activities like spinning/weaving, supervising slaves
            \item Wives of wealthier plantation owners rarely worked: generally mere showpieces
        \end{itemize}
        \item Less access to education w/ $\frac{1}{4}$ over 20 years old illiterate
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Wealthy planters rarely educated daughters
            \item Only female schools intended to train in being wife 
        \end{itemize}
        \item High birth rates -> $\uparrow$ infant mortality
        \item Slavery -> husbands often had affairs w/ female slaves, children becoming part of labor force 
        \item Some women -> abolitionists, joining northerners; others sought simple social reform; most lacked outlet, accepting position as distinctly Southern and placing them \underline{above poor}
    \end{itemize}
    \textbf{Wealthy women of the South rarely engaged in public activities and were even more subordinate to men due to the belief in honor requiring constant protection. Most were nearly isolated from society, lacking access to education, experiencing great infant mortality, and suffering the psychological effects of their husbands' affairs with female slaves. Although some women sought social reform through abolition, most accepted their position with little fight.}}
    \cornell{How did the lower southern classes grow in numbers and what were their social prospects?}{\begin{itemize}
        \item Most white southerners were modest farmers without slaves (those who did own some had them in $\downarrow$ numbers, worked closely together)
        \begin{itemize}
            \item 1850s saw $\uparrow$ nonslaveholding landowners faster than slaveowning ones 
        \end{itemize}
        \item Most aware of grim potential of social mobility
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Limited education for poor (universities important but only for planters' children) w/ non-universities generally poorly funded/maintained
            \item Isolation with little social influence -> why didn't they rebel against the aristocracy?
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \textbf{Most southerners worked without slaves, with the nonslaveholding class growing rapidly. They lacked potential for social mobility, with limited education and political influence.}}
    \cornell{How did some whites rebel against the planter aristocracy?}{\begin{itemize}
        \item Southern highlanders ("hill people") in Appalachians east of MS River, also in Ozarks to the west, and "backcountry" cut off from commerce 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Most isolated w/o slaves, subsistence agri. only
            \item Proud of seclusion, but rarely connected with growing economy of South
            \item No surplus contribution to market, using all additional crops to barter for other items
        \end{itemize}
        \item Highlanders despised slavery: threatened own beliefs of independence, created unnecessary focus on personal property; older ideals of nationalism
        \item Highlanders disliked planter aristocracy, rarely partaking in sectionalism
        \begin{itemize}
            \item During Civil War, some refused to support Confed. and some fought for Union 
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \textbf{The Southern highlanders disliked the planter aristocracy most significantly: mostly isolated from southern commercial growth, their independence led them to despise slavery and their nationalism caused them to rarely take sides in the Civil War, occasionally fighting for the Union.}}
    \cornell{What whites were more deeply ingrained in the planter aristocracy?}{\textbf{Most southern whites depended on the plantation economy to access cotton gins, sell their goods, and receive credit; they were often linked through kinship (direct relations weakened class tension). Furthermore, because the South was particularly democratic for white men, with many feeling a sense of direct influence (though most officeholders were elites). Finally, the cotton boom almost always helped smaller farmers to buy slaves, land, or secure their long-held positions with a slight boost.}}
    \cornell{How did smaller farmers stress a patriarchal social order?}{\textbf{Because many economies took place in the household, men felt that their hard rule on children and women would ensure productivity; furthermore, the Northern assault on slavery led many to fear a future assault on the patriarchy.}}
    \cornell{How did a class of "white trash" emerge in the South?}{\textbf{The most degraded class was the "poor white trash," living on infertile lands in small cabins and occasionally working for neighbors. Most sustained themselves through hunting and foraging, but were often forced to eat diseased clay, leading to the spread of significant disease. Many slaves, even, pitied their conditions. However, because most of the impoverished both lacked the money to rebel and felt a racial leadership over blacks, they rarely rebelled against their conditions.}}
